<h1> Term Project</h1>
<h2> Due date as specified on <a href="http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~jer/courses/ai/index.html">course syllabus</a> </h2>

<p>
You are strongly encouraged to form groups of two students for the term 
project.  Project proposals involving a single student can be 
considered, but the scope of the project should still be considered on 
par with that of two-student groups.

</p><p>

</p><h2>Introduction</h2> 

<p> For the term project, you are to propose an idea that embodies
some of the concepts you have learned (or are about to learn) in this
AI course.  The specific application that you decide to target is left
completely to your discretion, but it should be interesting, feasible
(within the time frame allotted) and well-suited to the efforts of two
students.

</p><p>
The instructor and/or TA will provide feedback regarding your
idea, possibly suggesting modifications, expansions or in some
cases, narrowing the scope of your proposal.  Note that you
<b> must</b> obtain approval of the instructor for your proposed
project.

</p><p>
Keep in mind that the time frame allocated to the project is similar
to that of the previous assignments.  As such, the scope of work
anticipated for each project member is of a similar nature.  Although
you are encouraged to explore topics of your own interest, this should
not require an investment of effort on par with a Masters thesis!
Specifically, you need not work on something brand new; a
re-implementation of an existing system is perfectly acceptable,
provided that you will learn something and have the opportunity to
gain relevant AI experience in the process.

</p><p>
The deliverables will include a report, describing your approach and
results as well as an in-class presentation during the final week of
the term.

  <tr>
    <td>Introduction &amp; Related Work</td>
    <td>0. none or incomprehensible</td>
    <td>1. The project's objectives are defined with a brief overview of
 the problem space. Other work is provided but it is not clear how it 
relates to the problem space or useful to understanding the projectâ€™s 
chosen approach.</td>
    <td>2. The project's objectives are defined and non-trivial. There 
is sufficient overview of the problem space so readers unfamiliar to the
 topic have enough background knowledge. A brief explanation of what 
course concept the project relates to is included. At least 2 related 
works are clearly described with a clear connection to the project.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Method</td>
    <td>0. none or incomprehensible</td>
    <td>1. The model implemented and data set used are  minimally 
described. There is little to no explanation of how the method was 
developed.</td>
    <td>3. The model implemented and data set used are described clearly
 enough that there are enough details that someone could replicate the 
project. There is an explanation of how the model was implemented and 
the implementation required more than using open ML libraries (e.g., 
scikit-learn). There is clear reasoning and justification behind the 
author's method.</td>
    <td>4. Along with the good criteria, there are attempts to improve 
performance after the first iteration of running the model whether it is
 by tuning parameters, adjusting training, or changing model(s). There 
is discussion on the how the performance was affected by these attempts 
with possible explanations.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Results</td>
    <td>0. none or incomprehensible</td>
    <td>1. The performance of the model(s) are stated.</td>
    <td>3. Graphs or tables are included to show performance of the 
model(s). The report describes and justifies the measure(s) used for 
evaluating performance. If more than one model was tested, there is a 
discussion of tradeoffs between models.</td>
    <td>4. Along with good criteria, to better evaluate performance, 
results of a random baseline and a standard ML method are provided (ML 
libraries can be used for this). There is discussion on how the authors'
 model compares.</td>

    <td>Discussion &amp; Conclusion</td>
    <td>0. none or incomprehensible</td>
    <td>1. A clear conclusion is drawn from the results and tied back to the stated objective in the introduction.</td>
    <td>2. Along with adequate criteria, the report discusses the 
successes and failures of their approach based on their results and 
objectives. Limitation of work and future improvements are discussed</td>

<h2> Presentation</h2>

<p>
The presentation, which accounts for 20% of your project mark, will
last approximately fifteen minutes per group (regardless of group
size) and should be seen as an opportunity to provide an overview of
what you accomplished and the results obtained.  Although quality of your
oral delivery will not be graded, per se, the articulation of
your accomplishments, as evidenced by the presentation, will factor as
part of your mark for the overall project.  You are thus strongly
encouraged to practice your presentation beforehand and make sure that
you stick to the time limits.  Otherwise, you will be cut off and this
may impact your grade.  Students are strongly discouraged from
alternating back and forth between the two presenters as this is
distracting and interrupts a smooth flow.

  <tr>
    <td>relevance to AI</td>

    <td>1. The project embodies a concept(s) learned in class, but does 
not extend what was learned in class or the project problem is trivial.</td>
    <td>2. Project clearly extends a concept learned in class that is 
moderately challenging enough that the students learned something new 
outside of the course curriculum.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Clarity of objectives and approach</td>
    <td>0. unclear</td>
    <td>2. The objectives are defined, but the approach is superficially
 described. For example, the approach is unclear or not fully justified 
in relating to the objectives.</td>
    <td>3. The objectives and the approach are clearly communicated and 
supported by a brief summary of  previous work done in the domain. There
 is justification for the approach chosen and how it relates to the 
objectives.</td>
    <td>4. Along with the good criteria, the presentation provides a 
clear conclusion discussing the pros/cons of their approach based on 
their results and objectives. Future improvements are proposed.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Technical content</td>
    <td>0. unclear</td>
    <td>2. The model(s) implemented, the data set used, and final 
results are minimally described. The results are stated but lacks 
analysis.</td>
    <td>3. Graphs and tables are appropriately used to describe the 
dataset and performance of the model(s). The evaluation measure for 
performance is defined and used to present clear results.</td>
    <td>4. Along with the good criteria, the group discusses attempts to
 improve performance. Meaningful analysis is provided on trade-offs 
faced (e.g. between models, parameter tunings, evaluation functions. 
This will vary on the project)</td>

<h2> Submitting your assignment</h2>

<p>
Your submission, made through Moodle, should consist of an IEEE 
conference format report, ideally 4-6 pages in length, including 
references.  Appendices, if included, to help readers understand your 
results, are not considered part of the page count.  A softcopy of your 
source code must also be included, with instructions to build and run.

</p><p>
Remember that your report is the main method of communicating what you
have accomplished to the reader.  Therefore, make sure that it is well
organized and well written.  Your peers will be reading and assessing 
this work, so it must be written in a manner accessible to a typical 
ECSE 526 student.
