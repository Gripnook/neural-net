# Artificial Neural Network

Neural network for the ECSE-526 project.

## Setup
To install all the dependencies, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Tkinter is required for the GUI tool. If it is not already included in your python distribution, it can be installed via `apt-get install python-tk`.

## Running

### GUI
To run the GUI tool, run the `main` method found in `main.py`.

### Fully Connected Network
To train and test our fully connected network, run the `main` method found in `mnist_fully_connected.py`.

### Convolutional Network
To train and test the TensorFlow convolutional network, run the `main` method found in `mnist_convolutional.py`.
